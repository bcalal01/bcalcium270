            <strong>Barry Callahan</strong> (born 11 January 2000) was a junior data scientist at the Southwest branch of
            the <a class="dtf_trigger" href="#">Department of Transmutational Faculties</a> (DTF). Callahan disappeared on the night of 14 January
            2026, after leaving work. Conflicting sources purport Callahan to have left at different times&mdash;security camera
            footage provided by DTF shows Callahan leaving the office building at 7:55 P.M., but
            several of Callahan's coworkers claim Callahan remained in the building as late as 9:13 P.M.
            The story received
            national media attention from its similarity to prior disappearances of federal employees in the Interstate Municipal Area,
            but a definite connection between them has not been established. Callahan's whereabouts remain unknown, but search efforts have ceased as of 20 January 2026.
            Callahan was described by others as intelligent and a hard worker.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>

        </p>
        <h2>Disappearance</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="body_text">
            On the day of 14 January 2026, Callahan arrived at the Bradshaw-Middlesex Office for Business at 8:55 A.M. Callahan's 
            colleagues reported that Callahan displayed no unusual behavior, remaining in his cubicle for the majority of
            the day. Callahan was working on a project analyzing the correlative relationship between algorithm-based social
            media usage and the discernment of reality and <a class="unreal_trigger" href="#">unreality</a>. The events that occurred after 7:00 P.M.
            have been the subject of much debate, but official police reports, in line with publicly released security footage,
            maintain that Callahan exited the building at 7:55 P.M. It is unclear if Callahan re-entered the building at a
            later point in the night (the building's back entrance, which Callahan could have entered through, is not under CCTV
            surveillance).
            The timeline found in the metadata of
            Callahan's working document revealed the last edit to the document was made at 10:11 P.M.
            It is unclear whether
            this edit was made by Callahan himself or another individual using his computer.
            Callahan's work remains unfinished.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            In the days following Callahan's disappearance and release of the security footage, search efforts began 
            in the surrounding area. Some have alleged that the security footage of Callahan's egress was doctored to
            show Callahan leaving at a different time than when he actually left. Several of Callahan's coworkers purport
            that they never witnessed Callahan leave the office. One coworker, Stephanie Billerica, reported that she saw
            Callahan working at his cubicle when she left at 9:13 P.M. Callahan's personal effects were found in his
            home in central <a class="date_trigger" href="#">Fearland</a>.
            Drone footage of the parking lot, part of a promotional video 
            posted online by a neighboring business, taken the morning of 15 January 2026, shows Callahan's car still in the parking lot.

        <h2>In popular culture</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Film and television</h3>
        <p class="body_text">
            The critically panned sci-fi romantic comedy <a class="steep_trigger" href="#"><em>The Steeplechase Runner</em></a> 
            was inspired by the mystery surrounding Callahan's disappearance. It was largely criticized for its ironic
            and "callous" approach to Callahan's disappearance.

            The <strong>Central Interstate Municipality (CIM)</strong> is a federally recognized union of independent city-state
            entities. It was formed in 2029 following the secession of several former states. The states that would
            later comprise the CIM seceded for various reasons, but the most prominent among them was the alleged voter
            disenfranchisement brought about by the dissolution of the federal <a class="house_trigger" href="#">House of Representatives</a>. The
            CIM is now classified as an independent and legally distinct self-governing territory.
        </p>
        <h2>Political Body</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="body_text">
            The CIM is recognized as a representative democracy. It has four branches of government, each of which retains certain
            privileges and duties. These branches are executive, legislative, judicial, and popular. The executive branch is
            responsible for upholding laws and regulations created by the legislative branch. The executive branch is headed by 
            the Governor, who is elected by popular vote and serves for 5 years. The Governor is eligible for re-election for up
            to 2 more terms. The legislative branch is comprised of one legislative body, called the 
            Representative Gallery, which consists of 189 representatives, one for each district in the CIM, elected
            by electoral college every 2 years. These positions have no <a class="term_trigger" href="#">term limits</a>.
            The judicial branch consists of 10 inferior courts and 3 superior courts, each in charge of ruling
            on the constitutional application of laws within the CIM. The judges that preside over each court are chosen by <a class="lot_trigger" href="#">lottery</a>
            every 7 years. The popular branch is responsible for enacting laws. When the legislative branch proposes a law, every citizen of
            voting age is required to vote for or against the proposed law, in a process called popular consent. If a 60% majority votes in favor of the law, it is
            codified into the CIM's Constitution. Each branch of government is instilled with checks and balances to ensure that no
            one branch harbors excessive power over the others.

            The <strong>Department of Transmutational Faculties (DTF)</strong> is an initiative by Governor 
            <a class="melanda_trigger" href="#">Melanda Merry-Go-Round</a>. Its stated objective is to improve the quantitative quality of transformative
            human-material interactions of citizens in 
            the <a class="arizona_trigger" href="#">Central Interstate Municipality</a>, especially concerning the human
            use of modern technology. It was first proposed in 2026 and was officially established in 2027. The department is comprised of 2,000 employees.
            As of 27 September 2028, DTF has reported achieving a 14% increase in the quality of the transformation of digital information to human
            thought among mobile phone users and a 16% increase in the quality of the transformation of digital information to human
            thought among personal computer users.

        <h3>Removal of cameras from cellular devices</h3>
        <p class="body_text">
            In January of 2028, DTF placed a moratorium on the installation of cameras in all cellular devices manufactured in
            the CIM, going into effect 12 February 2028. The official mandate released by DTF maintained that the existence of
            cameras on cellular devices allowed for the intake of unregulated digital material into a device. Independent review 
            conducted by DTF determined this unregulated material had a 34% chance of containing some element of 
            <a class="unreal_trigger" href="#">unreality</a>. Cameras themselves, unattached to a cellular device, as well as cameras in personal 
            computers, were determined to not share this same vulnerability to infiltration by unreal elements. 
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            Public response to this order was mixed. Per independent polling, 59% of citizens were in opposition to it, 14% 
            of citizens were in favor of it, and 27% of citizens were ineligible for polling. Despite the proposal's failure to
            surpass the 60% voter support necessary for popular consent, Governor Merry-Go-Round invoked
            an emergency executive order, which the superior courts deemed constitutional, allowing the 
            proposal to go into effect regardless. 
        </p>
        <h3>Eminent domain of virtual webspace</h3>
        <p class="body_text">
            In August of 2028, DTF proposed the expropriation of all virtual webspace across the CIM. This covers 780,000
            virtual acres of digital infrastructure. DTF cited concerns over the impossibility to regulate privately-owned
            digital spaces and thus monitor quality of virtual interactions that take place there. As compensation for
            the compulsory acquisition of the virtual land, DTF agreed to give credits worth up to $1,000 per acre to any
            proprietor who had their land acquired.
            The bill passed by popular consent with 60.1% of voters in favor of the proposal. As of September 2028, DTF has
            acquired 763,998 acres of virtual webspace, but no credits have been distributed to former owners yet.

        <hr>
        <p class="body_text">
            Carl Balustrade is a 26-year-old software engineer who lives alone in the 
            <a class="arizona_trigger" href="#">Central Interstate Municipality</a> He is heavily dissatisfied with
            his menial job, spending the entirety of his workday typing at his computer. He otherwise leads an
            isolated and lonely life&mdash;he has no friends and is unsuccessful at getting any matches on online 
            dating apps. His boss applauds him for his commitment to his work but admonishes him for his unwillingness
            to participate in workplace community-building events.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            One night, Carl is working alone at the office. He gets up from his computer to go to the restroom. While
            using the restroom, unbeknownst to Carl, the fluorescent lights in the office flash green rapidly.
            When Carl exits the restroom, he is startled by a blinding white light that envelopes him. He awakens to 
            find himself strapped to a table in a white medical examination room. A group of blue aliens enter the room,
            talking amongst each other in an alien language. One of them picks up a tool resembling a handsaw, then gestures
            to Carl. Using a paperclip, Carl is able to free himself from the restraints and attacks the group of aliens, 
            beheading one of them.

        <p class="body_text">
            Back on Earth, Carl's disappearance has gone unnoticed. Carl's boss, conversing with his supervisor,
            remarks at the quality of Carl's recent work. He recommends Carl to be recognized as employee of the month. He
            also mentions the absence of his secretary, Donna, and makes several misogynistic comments about her
            appearance.

        <p class="body_text">
            Back on the spacecraft, Carl is running through the maze-like hallways connecting the different rooms. One room
            he enters holds a caged giant mutant <a class="pray_trigger" href="#">grasshopper</a>. In another room he enters, he finds Donna, strapped to a chair.
            He frees her, fighting off another horde of blue aliens, beheading all of them. They decide they must find the
            control room, which Donna saw on a map of the ship. She leads them to the control room, solving puzzles and
            fighting aliens on the way there.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            Upon reaching the control room, they find the captain of the ship, a red alien. The alien tells them about his
            plan to destroy the earth with a laser to harvest the minerals comprising its molten core. To stop this plan,
            Carl hits several random buttons on the control panel, one of which opens the cage of the giant mutant grasshopper, which runs into the room and eats the red alien. However, one of the buttons Carl pressed activated the
            countdown sequence of the laser. Carl and Donna kiss as the laser obliterates the earth.

            <strong>Fearland</strong> is a minor county in the Southwest region of the 
            <a class="arizona_trigger" href="#">Central Interstate Municipality</a> (CIM). Fearland is home to 117,993 residents
            and 9,376 non-residents. It is the 5th most populous minor county in the CIM and the 17th most populous county in
            the CIM.

        <p class="body_text">
            Incorporated on 9 July 2003, Fearland was once known as the "Banana Shipping Capital of the World".

        <h2>History</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="body_text">
            Fearland began as a road stop in the late 1990s. It was a popular stop amongst truckers traveling cross-country.
            As Fearland grew in popularity, the federal
            government sponsored several business ventures in Fearland, aimed at supporting the burgeoning community. One of
            these initiatives included agriculture. The loose topsoil and nutrient-rich loam made
            the Fearland landscape ideal for farming. Following a dramatic climate shift, the agricultural industry
            in Fearland grew immensely, causing local businesses to flourish and the population to skyrocket.
        </p>
        <h2>Climate</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="body_text">
            Fearland has a hot, subtropical desert climate. This climate makes Southern Fearland an optimal
            environment for growing <a class="banana_trigger" href="#">bananas</a> that are genetically engineered to thrive in hot, subtropical

        <p class="body_text">
            <strong>Unreality</strong> is a classification used to refer to the aggregate sum of everything not in 
            existence. This includes entities and
            objects that are imaginary, falsified, and intangible.
        </p>
        <p class="body_text">
            The term was first used in 2023, following the immanentization of the 
            <a class="rapt_trigger" href="#">Technological Singularity</a>, whereupon the veil solidifying the distinction
            between the physical and virtual realms was flayed millions of time over into infinite
            individual fibers, forming a crystalline web that has forever enmeshed the two discrete
            dimensions into one immutable universe that is simultaneously tangible and digital.
        </p>
        <h2>Manifestation</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="body_text">
            Unreal things typically manifest as tangible holograms. These holograms exhibit qualitative similarities to
            the real things they attempt to mimic or an amalgamation of deconstructed real things. These holograms are not
            real, nor are they holograms in the traditional sense&mdash;as opposed to being created by light or lasers, the
            holograms that constitute unreal things are created by facsimiles of light and/or lasers. Unreal things are
            technically physical, as they are susceptible to human modes of perception (they can be touched, tasted, 
            heard, smelled, seen, etc.), but again, they are not real. Unreal things are not real.
        </p>
        <h2>Conflicting viewpoints</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="body_text">
            Unreal things do not exist, but some have argued that, by the nature of their nonexistence, they have 
            been made real purely as concepts. Believers in this school of thought have been called "agnostic
            unrealists". Critics of this belief, called "pure unrealists", believe that the innate non-presence 
            of atoms in unreal things, instead being comprised of virtual hallucinations, precludes them from "realness". 
            The school of pure unrealism is the viewpoint officially adopted by the

            Many of the circumstances surrounding her dissolution are unknown, but she was dissolved. Following the
            process by which she was dissolved, she was then reconstituted, using the desiccated corpses of several volunteers.
            This procedure successfully reconstituted Merry-Go-Round, but had the unintended side effect of granting her
            functional immortality. She does not age, nor does she grow, but she is still capable of being injured or killed

            "I see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express, my friend, that you expect to be 
            informed of the secret with which I am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end of my story,
            and you will easily perceive why I am reserved upon that subject. I will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent

            When I found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, I hesitated a long time concerning the manner in
            which I should employ it. Although I possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to prepare a frame for
            the reception of it, with all its intricacies of fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of
            inconceivable difficulty and labour. I doubted at first whether I should attempt the creation of a being
            like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to
            permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man. The materials at
            present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but I doubted not that I should
            ultimately succeed. I prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my operations might be incessantly baffled,
            and at last my work be imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes place in science
            and mechanics, I was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.
            Nor could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability. It was
            with these feelings that I began the creation of a human being. As the minuteness of the parts formed a great
            hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that
            is to say, about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. After having formed this determination and
            having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials, I began."
